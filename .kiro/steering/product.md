# Product Overview

Next.js DevTools MCP is a Kiro Power that connects AI coding agents to Next.js development tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Core Purpose

Provides three main capabilities for Next.js developers:

1. **Runtime Diagnostics** - Real-time access to build errors, runtime errors, TypeScript issues, routes, and logs from Next.js 16+ dev servers
2. **Development Automation** - Automated upgrades to Next.js 16, Cache Components setup, and browser testing with Playwright
3. **Documentation Access** - Searchable Next.js documentation and curated knowledge base resources

## Target Users

- Next.js developers using AI assistants for debugging and development
- Teams upgrading to Next.js 16
- Developers implementing Cache Components
- Anyone needing real-time application diagnostics

## Key Value

Bridges the gap between AI coding agents and live Next.js applications, enabling accurate debugging with real-time data instead of guessing or outdated information.
